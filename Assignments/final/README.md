# Philadelphia Eviction Prediction Model

An early warning system for predicting eviction filings at the census tract level in Philadelphia, developed for MUSA 5080: Public Policy Analytics.

## Project Overview

This project develops a predictive model to forecast monthly eviction filings across Philadelphia's 408 census tracts. The goal is to help the Philadelphia Housing Authority allocate prevention resources more effectively by identifying high-risk neighborhoods before evictions occur.

### Policy Context

Philadelphia experiences over 1,000 eviction filings per month, ranking among the highest eviction rates in the nation. Many evictions are preventable with timely intervention—legal aid, rental assistance, and tenant counseling. This model enables proactive resource deployment rather than reactive crisis response.

### Key Findings

1. **Evictions are predictable** - Past eviction patterns strongly predict future filings
2. **Geographic clustering** - Hotspots concentrate in North, West, and Southwest Philadelphia
3. **Racial disparities persist** - Majority-Black neighborhoods show elevated eviction rates even after controlling for income
4. **Model performance** - Enhanced Poisson model achieves MAE of 1.78 and correlation of 0.44 on test data

## Methodology

### Temporal Aggregation

Weekly data aggregated to monthly to address zero-inflation (68% zeros at weekly level → 34% at monthly level).

### Feature Engineering

- **Temporal lags**: 1-month and 2-month lagged eviction counts
- **Spatial lag**: Average evictions in k-nearest neighbors (k=5)
- **Demographics**: Poverty rate, renter percentage, median income
- **Distance features**: Distance to city center, distance to nearest hotspot
- **Hotspot indicators**: Local Moran's I classification (High-High clusters)
- **Interaction terms**: Poverty × racial composition, spatial lag × renter percentage

### Models Tested

| Model | Description | McFadden's R² |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Baseline Poisson | Temporal lags only | 0.14 |
| Full Poisson | + Spatial lag, demographics, race | 0.23 |
| Full Negative Binomial | Same as above, allows overdispersion | 0.22 |
| **Enhanced Poisson** | + Hotspots, month effects, interactions | **0.24** |

### Validation

- Train/test split (80/20, temporal split)
- Spatial autocorrelation check on residuals (Moran's I = 0.001, p = 0.33)
- Equity analysis across neighborhood racial compositions

## How to Reproduce

### Requirements

```r
# R packages
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",
  "sf",
  "spdep",
  "tidycensus",
  "lubridate",
  "MASS",
  "knitr",
  "ggplot2"
))
```

### Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Obtain Census API key and store in `.Renviron`:
   ```
   CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Download Eviction Lab data and place in `data/raw/`
4. Download 311 data from OpenDataPhilly and place in `data/raw/`
5. Open `eviction_prediction_enhanced.qmd` in RStudio
6. Run all chunks to reproduce analysis

## Key Outputs

- **Risk Classification Map**: Census tracts classified as Very High / High / Moderate / Low risk
- **Monthly Predictions**: Forecasted eviction counts by tract
- **Equity Analysis**: Model performance comparison across neighborhood demographics

## Limitations

- **Filings ≠ Evictions**: Model predicts court filings, not completed evictions
- **COVID-era training data**: 2020-2025 period heavily influenced by moratoriums
- **Census tract granularity**: Cannot identify individual households at risk
- **Equity concerns**: Higher prediction errors in majority-Black neighborhoods
- **Policy shocks**: Cannot anticipate sudden policy changes

## Ethical Considerations

- Risk of stigmatizing neighborhoods labeled "high risk"
- Model outputs should inform—not replace—human decision-making
- Access to predictions should be restricted to prevent misuse
- Implementation should include additional resources for historically underserved communities
